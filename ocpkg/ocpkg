# This is the main entry point for the ocpkg tool
# It now uses a modular structure where functionality is split into smaller files
# in the scripts directory for better maintainability

# Get the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Check if scripts directory exists
if [ ! -d "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts" ]; then
    echo "Error: Scripts directory not found at $SCRIPT_DIR/scripts"
    echo "Make sure the scripts directory exists and contains the necessary script files."
    exit 1
fi

# Source the main script
source "$SCRIPT_DIR/scripts/main.sh"

# Call the main function with all arguments
main "$@"
