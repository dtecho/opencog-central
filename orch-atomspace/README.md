# AtomSpace Orchestration

This directory organizes the various AtomSpace-related components and extensions within the OpenCog ecosystem. The AtomSpace serves as the hypergraph knowledge representation system at the core of OpenCog.

## Components

The AtomSpace ecosystem consists of the following components:

- **atomspace**: Core AtomSpace implementation - a hypergraph database and knowledge representation framework
- **atomspace-agents**: Agent-based processing for the AtomSpace
- **atomspace-bridge**: Bridge between AtomSpace and other systems
- **atomspace-cog**: Cogserver integration for AtomSpace
- **atomspace-dht**: Distributed Hash Table for AtomSpace
- **atomspace-explorer**: Visual exploration tools for AtomSpace
- **atomspace-ipfs**: IPFS integration for AtomSpace

- **atomspace-rpc**: RPC interfaces for AtomSpace
- **atomspace-typescript**: TypeScript bindings for AtomSpace
- **atomspace-websockets**: Websocket interface for AtomSpace

## Purpose

This orchestration directory:
1. Provides a logical organization of related components
2. Makes dependencies and relationships between components clearer
3. Simplifies navigation of the AtomSpace ecosystem
4. Facilitates coordinated development and testing

## Development

When working with AtomSpace components, please note their relationships and dependencies as documented in the individual component READMEs.
